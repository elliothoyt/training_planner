A training program generator tool.

3 main parts so far:
- generates a config based on your weekly schedule (ie: when you train)
- uses the config to ask for specific workouts for the following week
- pushes it to google calendar.

- Uses TKinter for a GUI

Future work:
Adding different training squads
Adding the ability to define and reuse workouts
Add location to the google calendar push
Adding Yearly training program ideas - ie: creating macro and meso cycles, with target volumes
then adding volumes to sessions, and displaying macro+meso data while doing weekly work.

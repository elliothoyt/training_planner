Core functionality work:
On open, ask to create or open existing training squad:
create training squad - document with links to subdirectories with all the below data
For YTP: ask for competition dates
assign weeks to macrocycles
divide macros in mesocycles of 3-5 weeks
Assign weekly scheduleconfig to a mesocycle

Nice to haves: 
- workout dictionary
- macro and mesocycle goals

Rework tkinter interface to be a grid with LHS being buttons for change/new training group, edit macrocycles, etc
centre grid is workspace
menus?
keyboard shortcut?
